    <p>Intermediate players should be taking the steps to develop a consistent approach and see that "planning" in chess begins as early as move one.</p>
    <h1>1. Extend your base knowledge of "tournament openings." </h1>
    <p>An intermediate player should be able to recognize most "main line" chess openings, even if he/she hasn't yet mastered them.
      Use <a href="https://www.chess.com/openings" target="_blank">Chess Openings</a> and <a href="https://www.chess.com/explorer" target="_blank">Chess Explorer</a> features to learn the first 7-10 moves of the following list of openings, commonly played by master-level chess players. 
      This should also help guide you if you are still unsure of a consistent approach for your own games (see Task #2).</p>
